**Project description:**
"“The Galaxy of the Algorithms: The escape from the BST planet” is a web-based learning game that teaches players about Binary Search Tree and Left-Leaning Red-Black Binary Search Tree concepts. The project is focused on gamifying the algorithm visualizations and providing teaching of algorithms through active learners’ involvement in the learning process rather than through passive learning through algorithm visualization." - from the exam report
